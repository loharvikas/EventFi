## Backend Architecture

The backend follows a **Layered Architecture** with clear separation of concerns. This makes the application scalable and maintainable.

### Layers:

1. **Views:**
   - Responsible for handling the view-related logic.
   - Manages API serialization and formatting of responses.
   - Acts as a bridge between the frontend and the backend services.
   
   Example:
   - Serializing API responses.
   - Handling HTTP requests and responses.
   
2. **Services:**
   - Contains the core business logic.
   - Handles data processing and business rule enforcement.
   - Interfaces with the model layer for data fetching or updates.
   
   Example:
   - Event creation logic.
   - Sending notifications or emails to users.
   
3. **Models:**
   - Defines the data structure and relationships.
   - Responsible for database schema representation and interactions.
   - Contains ORM (Object Relational Mapping) logic or direct database queries.
   
   Example:
   - User, Event, and Payment models.

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend follows a **Component Presentation Pattern**, which helps to create reusable and maintainable UI components.

### Structure:

1. **Components Folder:**
   - Contains all the reusable components.
   - Each component is modular and can be used across different pages.
   
   Example:
   - Button, InputField, Card components.

2. **Pages Folder:**
   - Contains all page-specific logic and UI components.
   - Each page folder represents a different section or feature of the application.
   
   Example:
   - Login page, Event List page, Dashboard page.

By following this architecture, we ensure that the code remains modular, reusable, and easy to maintain across both backend and frontend layers.
